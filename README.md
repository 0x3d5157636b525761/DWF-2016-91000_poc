Bezeq Netgear DGN2200 Exploit POC 2016
======================================
This POC demonstrates how to execute commands on the DGN2200 router (having Bezeq's firmware).
It demonstrates three vulnerabilities:
1. Command injection.
2. Authorization bypass.
3. CSRF.

Of course, using CSRF, a malicious attacker can make the victim run arbitrary commands on the router.
